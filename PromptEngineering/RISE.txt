The RISE prompt engineering technique is a structured framework that helps you design clear, goal-oriented prompts by breaking them into four components: Role, Input, Steps, and Expectation.

🧪 RISE Prompt Example: Power BI Copilot
Prompt:

Input: A dataset containing monthly revenue, expenses, and profit margins.
