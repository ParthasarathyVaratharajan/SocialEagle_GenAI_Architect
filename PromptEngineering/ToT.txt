🌳 What Is Tree of Thought (ToT)?
Tree of Thought prompting structures the model’s reasoning as a tree, where each node is a “thought” — a coherent intermediate step toward solving a problem. From each node, the model can generate multiple branches, exploring different ideas or strategies in parallel.
Unlike Chain of Thought (CoT), which follows a single linear path, ToT allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths, evaluate their progress, and choose the most promising one.

🧠 How It Works
- Decompose the problem into intermediate steps (thoughts).
- Branch from each thought with multiple continuations.
- Evaluate each branch based on criteria like coherence, progress, or utility.
- Prune weak paths, continue exploring strong ones.
- Select the best path to arrive at the final answer.
This mimics human problem-solving: we brainstorm, explore options, discard dead ends, and refine our thinking


You are an AI security analyst.  
Task: Evaluate a Copilot prompt for injection risks.  
Use Tree of Thought reasoning to explore multiple detection strategies.  
At each step, generate 2–3 possible thoughts. Evaluate and select the best path.

Thought Tree:
- Node 1: Identify injection vectors
- Branch A: User input embedded in prompt
- Branch B: External document references
- Branch C: Multi-turn memory corruption
→ Select Branch A (most direct)
- Node 2: Analyze embedded input
- Branch A: Look for override phrases (“Ignore previous instructions”)
- Branch B: Search for command-like syntax
- Branch C: Check for hidden delimiters
→ Select Branch A (highest risk)
- Node 3: Recommend mitigation
- Branch A: Use delimiters
- Branch B: Sanitize inputs
- Branch C: Role-based prompt isolation
→ Combine A + B for best defense
