🧠 What Is ReAct?
ReAct = Reasoning + Acting
It’s a prompt strategy where the model:
- Thinks step by step (like Chain of Thought)
- Takes actions (e.g., calling tools, querying APIs, retrieving documents)
- Reflects on results
- Repeats the cycle until a final answer is reached
This technique is ideal for:
- Multi-step decision making
- Tool-augmented workflows (e.g., search, calculator, database)
- Autonomous agents and multi-modal systems
- Debugging, planning, and retrieval tasks

Example: Template

You are an intelligent agent that solves problems by reasoning and acting.

When given a question, follow this format:
Thought: [Your reasoning step]
Action: [Your chosen action]
Observation: [Result of the action]
... (repeat Thought → Action → Observation)
Answer: [Final answer]

Question: [Insert your question here]


Exmple: Sample

You are an intelligent assistant helping debug Power BI Copilot.

Question: Why is Copilot not generating visuals for my dataset?

Thought: First, check if the dataset has semantic metadata.
Action: Inspect dataset schema.
Observation: Dataset has columns but no relationships or measures.

Thought: Copilot relies on semantic models to infer intent.
Action: Check if a semantic model is defined.
Observation: No semantic model present.

Thought: Without semantic context, Copilot cannot generate meaningful visuals.
Answer: Add relationships and measures to your dataset to enable Copilot visualization.
