The BAB prompt engineering technique stands for Before–After–Bridge — a storytelling-inspired framework that helps you craft persuasive, emotionally resonant prompts.

🧪 BAB Prompt Example: Power BI Copilot
Prompt:
Before: You’re using Power BI Copilot but struggling to get it to generate the right visuals.  
After: You want Copilot to consistently create accurate, business-relevant charts with minimal rework.  
Bridge: Let’s design a prompt using the RTCFR format to guide Copilot’s behavior clearly and reproducibly.

Expected Output:
Copilot responds with a structured visual recommendation, e.g., “Create a clustered column chart showing total revenue by region for the last quarter.”
