JSON Prompt Engineering is a structured prompting technique that uses JSON format to define tasks, inputs, and expected outputs — enabling clarity, consistency, and machine-readability in LLM interactions.

🧠 What Is JSON Prompting?
Instead of writing free-form natural language prompts, JSON prompting encodes instructions as structured key-value pairs. This format is both human-readable and programmatically parsable, making it ideal for:
- Tool-augmented LLMs
- Multi-agent systems
- API-driven workflows
- Prompt chaining pipelines
- Output validation and parsing

🧪 JSON Prompt Template
Here’s a basic structure:

{
  "role": "Power BI Copilot",
  "task": "Generate a DAX measure for YoY revenue growth",
  "input": {
    "table": "Sales",
    "columns": ["Date", "Revenue"]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "format": "DAX formula only",
    "explanation": true
  }
}

Expected OutPut:

{
  "dax_formula": "YoY Growth = DIVIDE([Total Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])), CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])))",
  "explanation": "This formula compares current revenue to last year using SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and calculates the percentage change."
}
