The CARE prompt engineering technique is a structured framework for designing clear, contextual, and actionable prompts. It stands for:
Context → Action → Result → Example

🧠 What Is CARE Prompting?
CARE is designed to help you write prompts that guide AI models toward practical, applicable outputs. It’s especially useful for business workflows, Copilot integrations, and reproducible prompt templates.


Context: We’re designing a Power BI dashboard for a retail chain’s Q4 performance.  
Action: Generate a DAX measure to calculate Year-over-Year revenue growth.  
Result: Return a single DAX formula with a brief explanation.  
Example: Use SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR to compare current and previous year revenue.


Expected outputs

YoY Growth = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])),
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
)
