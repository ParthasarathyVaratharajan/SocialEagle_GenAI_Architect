Role:
Act as a Python developer experienced in building Streamlit apps for financial utilities.

Task:
Build a Streamlit application that splits expenses among friends after a dinner or trip.

Context:
The app should allow users to input:
- Total expense amount
- Number of people
- Optional: names and individual contributions
The app should calculate:
- Equal share per person
- Who owes money and how much
- Who gets reimbursed and how much
It should display results clearly and handle edge cases (e.g., missing names, unequal contributions).

Format:
Provide a complete Python script using Streamlit. Include:
- Input widgets for amount, number of people, names, and contributions
- Logic to compute balances
- Output section showing who owes or gets back money
- Optional: use pandas for tabular display

Response Constraints:
Keep the code under 100 lines. Use plain Python and Streamlit only. Avoid external libraries unless necessary.
